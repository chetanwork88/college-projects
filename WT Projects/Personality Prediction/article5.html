				Researchers have long sought to answer the question, “Why do some people remember their dreams while others don’t?”<br><br>

Historically, the content of the dream itself was thought to be the main factor in whether or not it would be remembered. Sigmund Freud, in his seminal 1899 work The Interpretation of Dreams, noted several potential reasons why dreams are forgotten after waking up. Possible reasons include the images or emotions in dreams not being vivid enough, the tendency to forget an event (such as a dream) that only happens once, and the generally incoherent and unintelligible nature of dreams. One other possible reason: some people just don’t care if they remember their dreams or not.<br><br>

More recently, several physiological factors have been explored, ranging from brain activity to sleep deprivation. To determine which personality traits may influence dream recall, we asked our 16Personalities community to agree or disagree with the following statement: “You remember most of your dreams.”<br><br>

Our data provides fascinating clues that may, in fact, support some of Freud’s early assertions. For example, 65% of Intuitive personality types agreed that they remember most of their dreams – the highest agreement rate of all the individual traits – compared to 50% of Observant types. The Feeling, Judging, and Turbulent personality traits proved to be influential as well. Let’s explore these results in (psycho) analytical detail below.<br><br>

<h3>Social Engagement and Constant Improvement (61% and 59% agreeing) </h3>

Turbulent personality types were 5% more likely than Assertive types to agree that they remember most of their dreams. As Turbulent types, Social Engagers and Constant Improvers tend to experience a wide range of emotions, and they feel those emotions more intensely than their Assertive counterparts. As previously mentioned, intensity of emotion is one component of dream retention.<br><br>

Furthermore, Turbulent personalities are always looking for ways to improve themselves. This may make them more interested in remembering their dreams, if they believe that dreams contain hidden meanings that, when analyzed, can help them break through their challenges. Assertive personality types may be less inclined to utilize their energy for such a purpose.<br><br>

Social Engagers have a slight edge over Constant Improvers because of their Extraverted Minds. One scientific theory indicates that individuals who are more in tune with their external environment are more likely to remember dreams. Extraverted personalities are attracted to external stimulation, meaning that they experience greater influence from the outside environment while they are sleeping. You have probably experienced times where outside noises have filtered into your dreams. For example, you dream that you hear a fire alarm and are trapped in a building that is on fire – only to wake up and discover that your alarm clock is going off.<br><br>

Constant Improvers, as Introverted personality types, probably have a somewhat different experience. While Extraverts may absorb information from their external environment in dream form and recall it later, Introverts are more likely to be overwhelmed by the additional stimulation taking place, causing them to forget the content of their dream when they wake up.
