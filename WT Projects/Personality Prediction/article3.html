		“It’ll be five, ten minutes.” So Jerry, Elaine, and George are told – repeatedly – in a classic Seinfeld episode, “The Chinese Restaurant,” in which the friends attempt to eat dinner out before going to a movie. For the duration of the episode, we watch the three characters’ agitation grow as the host of the restaurant continues to seat other parties ahead of them.<br><br>


Jerry handles the situation the best, calmly saying of the perpetual “five-, ten-minute” wait time, “There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.” Elaine, who is famished, tries to rationalize why she should be seated right away, complaining, “You know, it’s not fair people are seated first come, first served. It should be based on who’s hungriest.” George, who meanwhile is desperately waiting to use the phone to call his girlfriend, completely loses it (his usual MO), shouting, “We’re living in a society! We’re supposed to act in a civilized way!” In the end, having run out of patience, they abandon both the restaurant and the movie. (And, inevitably, just seconds after they leave, the host finally calls out, “Seinfeld, four?”.)<br><br>

Aside from its humor, this episode of Seinfeld may offer insights into how different personality types react to the everyday situation of having to wait. While we will not attempt to type the sitcom’s quirky characters, it’s worth exploring some of the questions the episode raises. Why is it that some people are content to wait their turn, while others fly off the handle after just a few minutes? Does it make a difference if a delay is keeping us from something important or time-sensitive? And what role does personality type play in how we handle waiting?<br><br>

To find out, we asked our community whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement, “You get impatient when you have to wait, even if you don’t need to hurry.”<br><br>
