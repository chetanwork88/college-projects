			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Looking back at the knowledge we’ve gained over the course of our lives, most of us can point to at least one great teacher who helped us achieve something we never thought we could, revealed an exciting new way of seeing the world, or inspired a passion that continues to affect our lives. These teachers weren’t always in the classroom – they could have been coaches, family members, or work supervisors.</p><br>

			<p>But what made these teachers great? Was it the knowledge they carried? Their ability to communicate with others? The love they had for their students? Their ability to inspire? The organization and clarity of their lessons? </p><br>

			<p>We asked our community to weigh in on their own teaching ability by agreeing or disagreeing with the statement, “You have been called an excellent teacher,” and their answers may give us some insights into these questions. </p><br>


			<p><h3>Social Engagement (77%)</h3>

The best teachers make their job look easy, but as any first-timer can tell you, it takes a lot of confidence to step in front of a group of people and not only keep them engaged, but also impart knowledge or skills they will remember long after the lesson is over. Despite being Extraverted personality types, some Social Engagers may lack this natural confidence, due to their Turbulent Identity. But their hard work and obvious passion mean they can still be excellent teachers.<br>
<h3>Confident Individualism (70%)</h3>

Confident Individualists, as Introverts, may not feel as comfortable in a traditional teaching role that requires daily interaction with dozens of people. But as Assertive personality types, they know where their strengths lie and they have their material down cold. Confident Individualists are usually most interested in doing their own thing, so they’re likely to excel in positions where they can have the freedom to focus on their deepest interests with students or colleagues who are invested in learning. </p><br>	

			<p>
				<h3>Conclusions</h3>

Teaching is an extraordinarily challenging profession, and few of us are born with all the natural gifts it takes to be a great educator. The good news is that most of us seem capable of rising to the challenge under the right circumstances: overall, 71% of respondents said they have been called an excellent teacher.

Clearly, social and organizational skills, empathy, and confidence all play a role in being an excellent teacher. But is one personality aspect really more important than any other? Let us know what you think in the comments below!
