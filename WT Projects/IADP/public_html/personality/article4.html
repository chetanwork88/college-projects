		<div id="headline"><p>Using Questionable Work Hacks, by Personality Type</p>
		<i>1 month ago</i>

			<p>
			We live in the age of the “hack”: a clever way of doing something more efficiently or less expensively in any area of our lives, including work. For instance, is replying to emails eating up too much of your time? Type up some generic form emails that cover your most common communications and shoot them off quickly, rather than composing individual replies. Easy, right?<br><br>

But what if the company you work for expects you to personalize all of your emails, or what if in sending hasty, prewritten replies you miss important information? Would you still send those form emails?<br><br>

Some work hacks may be innocuous enough, but others raise questions, and some may even be expressly prohibited. Take as an extreme example the story of one U.S. software developer who outsourced his job to a contractor in China and paid just a fifth of his salary to do so! (Needless to say, that employee soon found himself unemployed.)<br><br>


While few people would show such utter disregard for workplace ethics, it can be difficult, when we’ve discovered a more efficient way to do something, to resist the temptation to do it, even if we know we’re not supposed to. To find out how personality type might influence people’s tendencies to use questionable work hacks, we asked our community whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement, “You use tricks and shortcuts that you are not supposed to use to get work done more quickly.”</p><br>
