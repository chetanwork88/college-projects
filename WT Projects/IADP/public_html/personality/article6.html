			<p>Loaning money to friends is a tricky business – few friendships are genuinely improved by the addition of financial obligations. We may find ourselves more willing to loan money to friends because we care about them and trust that they’re good for their word. But, in an economy of ups and downs and a busy world of distractions, timely repayment is never a guarantee. To make matters worse, some friends – consciously or not – may take advantage of our goodwill, treating the terms of the loan much too casually.<br><br>

When a friend fails to pay us back, speaking up about it can be a difficult thing. While some people have no qualms about demanding to be paid the money owed them (a certain Rihanna song comes to mind), for others, broaching the subject can be painfully uncomfortable. There’s a lot at stake, after all: our money and our friendship.<br><br>

To determine which personality types struggle the most with collecting debts, we asked our community whether they agreed with the statement, “You find it difficult to ask a friend to give you back the money they owe you.”<br><br>

Overall, 68% agreed, meaning that only about a third of our community feels strongly capable of following up with friends on money owed. But notable differences emerged between certain personality traits, particularly those relating to the Nature and Identity aspects. Lend us a few moments of your time to better understand the results below.<br><br>
<h3>Confident Individualism (65%)</h3>

As Introverted personality types who value self-reliance, Confident Individualists may actually refuse to lend money to friends in the first place, likely finding the concepts of debt and obligation in conflict with their ethos of personal freedom. When they do find themselves in such a situation, they are likely to resent having to ask their friend to pay them back. Thanks to their Assertive Identity, however, these personalities are unlikely to internalize any tension with their friend or feel they are responsible for the situation, and they can stay cool and deal with it directly, if not always easily.<br><br>
<h3>People Mastery (57%)</h3>

Only a slight majority of respondents in the People Mastery Strategy agreed, as their Assertive and Extravert personality traits give them more personal confidence in dealing with people, making challenging conversations easier. Although People Masters have a deep regard for their friends’ welfare, they also have high self-esteem, so they can assert their own needs clearly while still taking care of the needs of others. They are the most likely to find a charismatic way to make their request and convince friends to agree to pay them back – and then move on with their friendship.<br><br>

Of all the personality types, Assertive Executives (ESTJ-A) and Assertive Commanders (ENTJ-A) agreed the least (40% each). Skilled administrators and strong-willed leaders, these types possess Thinking and Judging traits that give them an emotional objectivity and a desire for order and closure. Thanks to their Extraverted and Assertive traits, they can confidently remind friends of their responsibilities in a direct and honest way that gets results.
