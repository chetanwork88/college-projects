			<p>Home improvement has been an undeniable trend in recent years that just keeps growing. Stock in major retailers like Home Depot is on the rise, and HGTV is consistently one of the top 10 most-watched cable networks in America. It seems like you can’t turn on your television without seeing some plucky TV personality or homeowner restoring, trading, or flipping spaces. Apparently, people are just as riveted by battles with ugly wallpaper and toxic drywall as they are by zombies and dragons.<br><br>

We were curious to see whether some personality types are more likely than others to be interested in home improvement, so we asked our community to respond to the statement, “You often come up with various home improvement projects.”
<br><br>
Overall, we found that more than half of respondents (57%) agreed with this statement – a fairly neutral result. Looking closer, though, the responses of many personality types varied widely, and some were even a bit counterintuitive. 

<h3>Analysts and Diplomats (60% each agreeing)</h3>

Analysts and Diplomats tied as the Roles most likely to say that they often come up with home improvement projects. The Intuitive personality trait is a key factor here, as it gives Analysts and Diplomats the imagination and vision to think up creative new ideas for their homes. Intuitive types were also 7% more likely to agree with our statement than Observant types (60% vs. 53% agreeing).<br><br>

Out of all the personality types, Commanders (ENTJ) and Protagonists (ENFJ) were the most likely to have home improvement on the brain, with 75% and 73% agreeing, respectively. Apparently people with strong leadership skills also tend to have an affinity for remodeling their kitchens or building out their back decks.<br><br>

In many ways, a home construction project is particularly ideal for Commander personalities; it requires creativity, vision, and follow-through, which they have in spades. Its challenges also tend to be technical, not personal, meaning Commanders won’t need to venture too far out of their comfort zone to get the job done.<br><br>

It should be noted that Analysts’ and Diplomats’ responses were divided around the Judging trait – Commanders and Protagonists may have agreed at high rates, but personality types with the Prospecting trait, like Logicians (INTP) (50%) and Mediators (INFP) (52%) showed much lower agreement. Let’s look at our next Role, Sentinels, to understand the impact of the Judging trait on this survey.<br><br>
<h3>Sentinels (59%)</h3>

Falling just barely behind Analysts and Diplomats, Sentinel personality types were much more consistent in their responses. Overall, Judging types were 11% more likely than Prospecting types to agree that they frequently come up with home improvement projects (63% vs. 52% agreeing)<br><br>.

The Judging trait gives Sentinels the ability to effectively plan home improvement projects, including feasibility, logistics, costs, materials, techniques, and timelines – all details that Prospecting personality types tend to be somewhat averse to. Furthermore, Sentinels’ practicality, their love of family, and their work ethic make home improvement a natural fit in their range of interests.<br><br>
<h3>Explorers (44%)</h3>

Explorers were significantly less likely to agree with our statement, due to the influence of their shared Prospecting trait. When one sees many possibilities for a space, it can be hard to decide on just one – and hard to live with if the results are less than ideal. The biggest deterrent for Explorer personality types is probably having to commit to seeing a home improvement project through to completion, which could keep them from pursuing more entertaining activities.<br><br>

Adventurers (ISFP) and Virtuosos (ISTP) were the least likely of all personality types to agree (39% each). It’s hard to imagine many Adventurers locking themselves into a long-term project with little opportunity for improvisation or self-exploration. But one might expect Virtuoso personalities to be drawn to the prospect of wielding fun toys like reciprocating saws, sledgehammers, laser levels, and hammer drills. Given Virtuosos’ need for excitement – and their dislike of drudgery – they are probably more likely to come up with short-term projects that can be abandoned or modified on the fly.
